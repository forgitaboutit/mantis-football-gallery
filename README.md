## General Info
The previous contents of mantisfootball.net now reside here. I was paying ~$23/month for an Amazon EC2 instance, and it would have cost even more if there was any real traffic. Here it is hosted at no cost. In the event of my death Amazon would surely shut down the EC2 instance as soon as the payments stopped arriving. Here it will live forever. At first I thought I was being clever and working the system, but [GitHub actually encourages this](https://pages.github.com/). After all, it is a software project. Before long the mantisfootball.net domain will point to the contents of the link below.
